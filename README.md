- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BrimCap
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding discord bots
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and javascript

[BoredomBot](https://github.com/BrimCap/BoredomBot) is a bot I'm working on. It's not public and probably won't go public ever. But it's been a fun project that helped me learn a lot of python!

> PS. I don't recommend getting started with python using discord.py ğŸ˜¬
